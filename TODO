Still to do:

su3.g










Things to change in many files:

1. What to do with multiple definitions of the same func?
2. What does <Evaluate> do?
3. What does <Universe? do?
4. How to implement <InsertBlock>?
5. What does <Trace(RingElt, field)> do?
6. What does <SubStructure> do?
7. How to implement Log with finite field elts?
8. What does <IsPower(RingElt, Integer)> do?

The file su3 needs looking at in more detail - there are functions such as MatrixToTuple and TupleToMatrix that I think will require more thought to change.
